# puzzle
 Very often in fairs we come across a puzzle that contains 15
numbered square pieces mounted on a frame. These pieces
can be moved horizontally or vertically. Draw the boxes.  Display the numbers 
in the above order. Allow the user to hit any of the arrow keys (up,
down, left, or right).

If user hits say, right arrow key then the piece with a number
5 should move to the right and blank should replace the
original position of 5. Similarly, if down arrow key is hit, then
13 should move down and blank should replace the original
position of 13. If left arrow key or up arrow key is hit then no
action should be taken.

The user would continue hitting the arrow keys till the
numbers arenï¿½t arranged in ascending order.
Keep track of the number of moves in which the user manages
to arrange the numbers in ascending order. The user who
manages it in minimum number of moves is the one who
wins.
